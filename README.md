This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Questions

1. Currently, the search box just makes an alert appear. Let's get it working and actually make it return any recipe that start with the search term.
1. The sort order dropdown doesn't actually do anything. Let's get it working so that it sorts based on the selected value in the dropdown.
1. It's hard to read the recipe. How do you suggest we organize the content? Can you make those adjustments?
1. Sort dropdown and label should appear on the same line as the search box, at the very right of the screen.
1. Can you add infinite scroll so that we're not loading 100 recipes at a time?
1. We want the search function to be smarter. What are some improvements we could make? How would you do this?
1. Add an endpoint that would allow users to add a recipe.
1. Create an add recipe button and form.
1. Any other suggestions on how we could improve the code and application?
